1. Find the sum of the energy, valence, and dancibility of all songs combined. Divide by 300

2. Even though this method is a good starting ground, it is not very representative in many
ways.

Firstly, the maximum score of each of the three factors differ from one another.
For example, scores for 'valence' range from 0 to 1, while scores for 'dancibility' seem to
always be negative. This causes the 3 factors to affect the overall 'Audio Aura' score
to unequal and disproportionate extents.

Hence, scores for each factor should be divided by its maximum score before the step in 1.
is performed. If the range of values a factor could take is negative, we can add the value
of the factor by a postive constant number such that the lower limit for the range is now 0,
for every of the top 100 songs, before proceeding with the dividing of its respective maximum
scores. However, if the 'Audio Aura' score is determined to be more reflective by differing
importance from each of the 3 factors, each of the 3 factors may be multiplied by their
respective predetermined proportional constants after the division by its maximum score.

Secondly, not everyone might have covered at least 100 songs for this formulae to work.
Assuming they do, listening times of different songs may differ significantly, especially
when songs might have only been played once before being included in the top 100, or if
the top few songs are played way more frequently than the others. Treating the data of all
songs in the top 100 the same gives disproportional priority to songs lower on the list,
skewing the reflectiveness of the resulting 'Audio Aura' score.

Hence, we should take into account listening time for each song, multiplying it to the
value of the respective score's 3 factor-included sum, diving by a constant, before summing
all the resulting values for all songs up.
